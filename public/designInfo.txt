Step 1 - Understand the Project
Project Goals
1. What is the primary objective of this app?
-The primary objective is to provide information and organize information for the user
    a. First, they find recipes from an external API. They can look over the details of each recipe before deciding on whether to keep it
    b. Second, we keep track of saved recipes, and allow them to pull up pertinent information whenever they'd like
    c. The weekly planner lets them take recipes that are already saved, and then put them into days, allowing them to organize for a week's worth of meals
    d. We generate grocery lists for the ingredients from the recipes they have in their weekly planner. This organizes data for easy use to take to the store

2. Who is the target audience?
-The target audience is more general; anyone looking to organize their meals, or find ideas for meals.
-The big feature is simplicity in use; we want a simple user interface that either drags or clicks for its functionality.

3. User Insights
-Other users have indicated they'd like a few features:
    a. ingredients placed into categories to allow for pre-organization before going to the store
    b. combination of ingredients, so there aren't 4 entries for milk
    c. being able to add their own recipes to this program

4. User Scenarios
-The first would be the standard flow: Login -> Recipe Search -> Meal Planner -> Drag Recipes -> Generate Grocery List
-They should be able to just go to meal planner directly and see what they've already put together
-A user can use this for three main purposes:
    a. Finding/Saving Recipes
    b. Organizing meals for the week
    c. Generate Grocery List

5. Establish Constraints
-Our API is free, but has some issues. Specifically, data is not organized according to a specific syntax. Users can enter many styles of ingredients, which can make parsing them difficult
-We've never used Drag n Drop before on an App. I think it's a great user experience, but we'll need to make sure we can make it work behind the scenes
-Time. We only have so long, and when jumping into things we're not familiar with it can take more than we expect

Step 2 - Map Out your User flow
1. User Goals
-Like above, there are three main goals that the user would want:
    a. Finding/Saving Recipes
    b. Organizing meals for the week
    c. Generate Grocery List

2. Key Touchpoints

3. Seamless Transitions / Interactive paths
Login
-Should be directed there at the first, session check
-> After Login
Taken to Landing page, which has instructions and a button to direct to recipe search
-> Header
Includes the recipe search, weekly planner, and ?Grocery List? portions, so that a user can travel between them whenever they'd like
-> Recipe search
Text search, which leads to recipe cards being displayed. There's a picture and a title on each card. If the user is intriguided, they can click on the card to open more details, such as ingredients and instructions.
-> Recipe save
If a user likes a recipe, they can save it with a simple click. They can also unsave it with that same mechanic
-> Weekly Planner
-A user's recipes will be automatically loaded when they come to this page. They'll be in the same style as the recipe search page
    -**** Saved Recipe Search. How exactly do we want this to look?
-The actual planner will be next to the saved recipes, each column side by side. This allows for simple drag n Drop
-The recipe will copy into the planner, and can be further moved around as desired. Each recipe will also have a delete option to remove it from the planner
-There will be a button for adding a week, as well as clearing a week. 
-There will be a button to generate the shopping lists
-> Grocery List
-Ingredients will be automatically combined and organized from all of the recipes within the weekly container.
-Each ingredient will have an indicator that the ingredient has been gotten or not. Checkbox most likely
